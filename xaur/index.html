	<meta name="description" content="This document lists user needs and requirements for people with disabilities when using virtual reality or immersive environments, augmented or mixed reality and other related technologies (XR). It first introduces a definition of XR as used throughout the document, then briefly outlines some uses of XR. It outlines the complexity of understanding XR, introduces some accessibility challenges, and introduces accessibility multimodal support for a range of input and output devices, the importance of customization. Based on this information, it outlines accessibility user needs for XR and their related requirements, followed by information about related work that may be helpful to understand the complex technical architecture and processes behind how XR environments built and what may form the basis of a robust accessibility architecture for XR."><link rel="canonical" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/"><style>var {

			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>This document lists user needs and requirements for people with disabilities when using virtual reality or immersive environments, augmented or mixed reality and other related technologies (<abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>). It first introduces a definition of <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> as used throughout the document, then briefly outlines some uses of <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>. It outlines the complexity of understanding <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>, introduces some accessibility challenges, and introduces accessibility multimodal support for a range of input and output devices, the importance of customization. Based on this information, it outlines accessibility user needs for <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> and their related requirements, followed by information about related work that may be helpful to understand the complex technical architecture and processes behind how <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environments built and what may form the basis of a robust accessibility architecture for <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>.</p>
			
			<p>This document is most explicitly not a collection of baseline requirements. It is also important to note that some of the requirements may be implemented at a system or platform level, and some may be authoring requirements.</p>

<p><abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> is an acronym used to refer to the spectrum of hardware, applications, and techniques used for virtual reality or immersive environments, augmented or mixed reality and other related technologies. This document is developed as part of a discovery into accessibility related user needs and requirements for <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>. This document does not represent a formal working group position, nor does it currently represent a set of technical requirements that a developer or designer need strictly follow. It aims to outline for the reader some of the diversity of current accessibility related user needs in <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> and what potential requirements to meet those needs may be.</p>

<p>As with the <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/">WebXR API spec</a> and as indicated in the related <a href="https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/master/explainer.md#what-is-webxr">WebXR explainer</a>, this document uses the acronym <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> to refer to the spectrum of hardware, applications, and techniques used for virtual reality or immersive environments, augmented or mixed reality and other related technologies. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Immersive or augmented environments used for education, gaming, multimedia, 360ยฐ content and other applications.</li>
<li>Head mounted displays, whether they are opaque, transparent, or utilise video passthrough.</li>
<li>Mobile devices with positional tracking.</li>
<li>Fixed displays with head tracking capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The important commonality between them being that they all offer some degree of spatial tracking with which to simulate a view of virtual content as well as navigation and interaction with the objects within these environments.</p>

<p>Terms like "<abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> Device", "<abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> Application", etc. are generally understood to apply to any of the above. Portions of this document that only apply to a subset of these devices will be indicated as appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="x3-understanding-xr-and-accessibility-challenges"><bdi class="secno">3. </bdi>Understanding <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> and Accessibility Challenges<a class="self-link" aria-label="ยง" href="#understanding-xr-and-accessibility-challenges"></a></h2>

<p>Understanding <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> itself presents various challenges that are very technical. They include technical issues with a range of hardware, software, authoring tools as well as a need to understand interaction design principles, accessibility semantics and more. These all represent 'basic' technical complexities that are in themselves substantial. To add to this, for many designers and authors they may neither know or have access to people with disabilities for user testing. Neither may they have a practical way of understanding user needs that they can build a solid set of requirements from. In short, they just may not understand what user needs they are trying to meet when making <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> accessible.</p>

<p>Some of the issues in <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>, for example in gaming, for people with disabilities including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Over emphasis on motion controls</strong>. The are many motion controllers that emphasise using your body to control the experience. Some games with <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> components may lock out traditional control methods when a VR headset is being used, and the user should always be able to use a range of input mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>VR Headsets need the user to be a physical position to play</strong>. The user should not have to be in a particular physical position to play a game or perform some action. Or there should be ability to remap these 'physical positions' to other controls (such as using <a href="https://www.walkinvrdriver.com">WalkinVRDriver</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Games and hardware being locked to certain manufacturers</strong> Consoles should allow full button remapping on standard game controllers - to different types of assistive technologies such as switches. These remapping preference should be mobile, and transportable across a range of hardware devices and software.</li>
<li><strong>Gamification of VR forces game dynamics on the user</strong>. Some users may wish to just explore an immersive environment without the 'game', or any particular challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Audio design lacks spatial accuracy</strong> sound design needs particular attention and can be critical for a good user experience for people with disabilities. In deed the auditory experience of a game or other immersive environment may 'be' the experience [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-able-gamers" title="Thought On Accessibility and VR">able-gamers</a></cite>].</li>

</ul>

<p>There are also a range of other disabilities that will need to be considered in making <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> accessible. It is beyond the scope of this document to describe them all in detail. General categories or types of disabilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auditory disabilities</li>
<li>Cognitive disabilities</li>
<li>Neurological disabilities</li>
<li>Physical disabilities</li>
<li>Speech disabilities</li>
<li>Visual disabilities</li>
</ul>


<p>A person may have one of these disabilities or a combination of several. Each of these 'types' will be presented as a user need that should be met and understanding these needs are crucial in rising to the range of  interesting challenges <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> designers and authors will have when supporting accessibility and multimodality in <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environments.</p> 

<p>These may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understanding specific diverse user needs and how they relate to <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>.</li>
<li>Successfully identifying modality needs that are not obvious - but still need to be supported.</li>
<li>Having suitable authoring tools for designers that support accessibility requirements in <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>.</li>
<li>Using languages, platforms and engines that support accessibility semantics.</li>
<li>Successfully abstracting <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> applications by providing accessible alternatives for content and interaction.</li>
<li>The provision of specific commands within the VR environment (e.g., to go directly to a specified location or to follow another user) which assist with non-visual navigation.</li>
<li>The use of virtual assistive technologies (e.g., white cane via a haptic device) to provide non-visual feedback. The research identified that if the same audio cues associated with a real-world infrared white cane were used in immersive environment, users were able to effectively centre themselves in the middle of pathways and walk successfully through virtual doorways based on the same audio feedback as used in the equivalent real-world device [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-maidenbaum-amendi" title="Non-visual virtual interaction: Can Sensory Substitution generically increase the accessibility of Graphical virtual reality to the blind?">maidenbaum-amendi</a></cite>]</li>

<p>Some of the many challenges with immersive environments accessibility (and also gaming) include the use of extremely complex input devices, control schemes that require a high degree of precision, timing and simultaneous action; ability to distinguish subtle differences in busy visual and audio information, having to juggle multiple complex goals and objectives [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-web-adapt" title="W3C Workshop on Web Games Position Paper: Adaptive Accessibility">web-adapt</a></cite>].</p>

	<p>There are also currently very useful accessibility guidelines available that are specific to gaming [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-game-a11y" title="Game Accessibility Guidelines">game-a11y</a></cite>].</p>

<p>Modality relates to modes of sense perception such as sight, hearing, touch and so on. Accessibility can be thought of as supporting multi-modal requirements and the transformation of content or aspects of a user interface from one mode to another that will support various user needs.</p> 

<p>Considering various modality requirements in the foundation of <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> means these platforms will be better able to support accessibility related user needs. There will be many modality aspects for the developer and/or content author to consider. <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> authors and content designers will also need access to tools that support the multimodal requirements listed below. </p>

<p>The following Inputs and Outputs can be considered modalities that should be supported in <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environments.</p>

</section>

<section id="various-input-modalities">
<h3 id="x3-3-various-input-modalities"><bdi class="secno">3.3 </bdi>Various input modalities <a class="self-link" aria-label="ยง" href="#various-input-modalities"></a></h3> 

<p>The following are example of some of the diverse input methods used by people with disabilities. In many real world applications these input methods may be combined.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Speech</strong> - this is where a user's voice is the main input. Using a range of voice commands a user should be able to navigate in an <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environment, interact with the objects in that environment using their voice alone.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard </strong> - this is where the keyboard alone is the user's main input. A user should be able to navigate in an <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environment, interact with the objects in that environment using the keyboard alone.</li>
<li><strong>Switch </strong> this is where a since button Switch alone is the user's main input. A user should be able to navigate in an <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environment, interact with the objects in that environment using a Switch alone. This switch may be used in conjunction with an assistive technology scanning application within the <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environment that allows them to select directions for navigation, macros for communication and interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Gesture </strong> - this is where gesture based controllers are the main input and can be used to navigate in an <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environment, interact with the objects in that environment make selections using their voice alone.</li>
<li><strong>Eye Tracking</strong> - this is where eye tracking applications is the main input. Using a range of commands a user should be able to navigate in an <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environment, interact with the objects in that environment using these eye tracking applications.</li>

<p>The following are a list of outputs that can be available to a user to help them understand, interact with and 'sense' feedback from an <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> application. Some of these are in common use on the Web and other exploratory (such as Olfactory and Gustatory.)</p>

<ul>

<li>Tactile - this is using the sense of touch, or commonly referred to as haptics.</li>
<li>Visual - this is using the sense of sight, such as 2D and 3D graphics.</li>
<li>Auditory - this is using the sense of sound, such as rich spatial audio, surround sound.</li>
<li>Olfactory - this is the sense of smell.</li>
<li>Gustatory  - this is the sense of taste.</li>

<section id="xr-controller-challenges">
<h3 id="x3-5-xr-controller-challenges"><bdi class="secno">3.5 </bdi><abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> controller challenges<a class="self-link" aria-label="ยง" href="#xr-controller-challenges"></a></h3>

<p>As mentioned there are a range of input devices that may be used. Supporting these controllers requires an understanding of what they are and how they work.
There are a variety of alternative gaming controls that may be very useful in <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environments and applications. For example the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller ">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>.</p>

<p>While <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> is the experience, the controller is king, and plays a critical part in overcoming some complexity as well as mediating issues that may relate to other challenges around usability and helping the user understand sensory substitution devices. </p>

<p>Controllers such as the Xbox Adaptive Controller and other switch type inputs allow the issuer to remapping keyboard inputs to control virtual environments. The powerful customizations may allow the user to "do that thing that is difficult" for them with ease.  In conjunction with this controller, for example, users with limited mobility they can also simulate actions in the <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environment that they would not be able to physically perform.  <a href="https://www.walkinvrdriver.com">WalkinVRDriver</a> is a good example of this where motion range, position and orientation can be set to the user's ability.</p>

<p>Give the user the ability to modify their input preference or use a variety of input devices. The remapping of keys used to control movement or interaction in virtual environments is not currently required by WCAG. It is nevertheless noted in the literature as desirable.</p>

<p>A user with a disability may have several input devices. A user may switch 'mode' of interaction or the tools used and should be able to do so without degrading into a poor user experience where they lose focus on a task and cannot return to it, or make unforced errors, accidental input and so on.</p>

<p>There may be tracking issues when switching input devices. A tracking issue is where the user may lose their focus or it can be modified in unpredictable or unwanted ways, this can cause loss of focus and potentially push the user to make unwanted inputs or choices.</p>

<p>Outputs sent to multiple devices will need to be synchronised.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> application should have a high level of usability for someone with a disability who is using assistive technology. Some challenges in translating interaction models may be:</p>

<ul>

<li>How can a user understand the affordance models used in <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> interactions? Or can this be mediated by their own interaction preferences and controllers?</li>
<li>What interactions are allowed or not allowed? </li>
<li>How can an accessibility abstracted <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> experience focussed on supporting a different modality, successfully interact with another?</li>

<p>Other documents that relate to this and represent current work in the RQTF/APA are:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/XRA-Semantics-Module"><abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> Semantics Module</a> - this document outlines proposed accessibility requirements that may be used in a modular way in immersive, augmented or mixed reality (<abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr>).  A modular approach may help us to define clear accessibility requirements that support <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> accessibility user needs, as they relate to the immersive environment, objects, movement, and interaction accessibility. Such a modular approach may help the development of clear semantics, designed to describe specific parts of the immersive eco-system. In immersive environments it is imperative  that the user can understand what objects are, understand their purpose, as well as another qualities and properties including interaction affordance, size, form, shape, and other inherent properties or attributes.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/WebXR_Standards_and_Accessibility_Architecture_Issues"> WebXR Standards and Accessibility Architecture Issues</a> - this document is informative and aims to outline some of the challenges in understanding the complex technical architecture and processes behind how <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> environments are currently rendered. To make these environments accessible and provide a quality user experience it is important to also understand the nuances and complexity of accessible user interface design and development for the 2D web. Any attempt to make <abbr title="Virtual and Augmented Reality">XR</abbr> accessible needs to be based on meeting the practical user needs of people with disabilities.</li>
